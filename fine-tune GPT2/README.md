# ${\color{cyan}\text{Fine-tune GPT2-medium}}$
This directory contains my dataset and a jupyter notebook which shows you how to fine-tune a GPT2-medium. You can fine-tune it on your own data and then save it to your drive and then use it for `Self_Talker.ipynb` first step which is about generating text.


Please note that you should change your runtime type to GPU if you're using Google Colab.


If you encounter challenges while fine-tuning the GPT-2 medium model, considering the utilization of the GPT-2 small model could be a viable alternative. The medium variant encompasses an impressive 345 million parameters, while the small variant offers a slightly more modest yet still formidable 117 million parameters. This distinction in parameter count between the two models can be a determining factor in facilitating smoother fine-tuning processes and optimizing resource allocation.

However, it is equally important to evaluate the specifics of your dataset before making a decision. Conducting a thorough analysis of your data will provide invaluable insights into the optimal approach. Consider the volume of your dataset and the available computational resources at your disposal.

If your dataset is relatively small or your computational resources are limited, the GPT-2 small model, with its 117 million parameters, could prove to be a more pragmatic choice. This model size offers a balance between computational efficiency and model performance.

On the other hand, if your dataset is large and you have access to robust computational infrastructure, the GPT-2 medium model, with its impressive 345 million parameters, may provide enhanced capabilities for capturing intricate patterns and generating more sophisticated outputs.
